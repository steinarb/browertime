* Introduction

The perl script in this repository converts fixed width files from
[[http://www.browertiming.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=105:ski-racing&catid=83:xs-timing-system][Brower timers]] into CSV files appropriate for upload into google docs
spreadsheets.

* Preconditions

The script has been developed on [[https://www.debian.org/][debian]], but should be able to run on
any command line with the following programs in the PATH:
 - [[https://www.gnu.org/software/make/][GNU make]]
 - [[http://www.perl.org/][perl]]

[[http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm][GNU make from GnuWin32]] and [[http://strawberryperl.com/][Strawberry Perl]] should be enough to run
this script on Windows systems.

* Doing conversion

The steps for doing a conversion, are:
 1. Copy the .txt file exported from the Brower clock into the
    directory containing the script
 2. Open a command line window on the directory containing the script
    (and the .txt file), and give the command:
    : make
 3. Create a new spreadsheet on Google docs
 4. In the spreadsheet, choose File->Import
 5. In "Import File":
    1. Click on "Choose..." and browse to the .csv file
    2. Select "Replace spreadsheet"
    3. Click on the "Import" button
